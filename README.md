### Product Brief
This is a register of all your items that you consider to be loanable, which also registers if they are currently loaned out, and to whom, and how long ago. The goal of this product is to help you track the items you own that you have loaned out, to ensure no items are lost/forgotten about.

### Run the code locally
Have ```Node v16``` installed
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
